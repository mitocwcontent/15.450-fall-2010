Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course covers the main quantitative methods of finance. The course covers three broad sets of topics: derivative pricing using stochastic calculus, dynamic optimization, and financial econometrics. The emphasis is on rigorous and in-depth development of the key techniques and their application to practical problems.

Prerequisites
-------------

_15.401 Finance Theory I_ is a prerequisite for this course. _15.437 Options and Futures Markets_ is a recommended co-requisite.

Rudimentary programming skills are necessary. Homework assignments involve computer implementation of quantitative methods in MATLAB®. Prior knowledge of MATLAB® is not required. In addition to formal prerequisites, the course assumes solid undergraduate-level background in calculus, probability, and statistics.

The lectures will include suggestions for additional readings for each topic. Since there is no single textbook covering all the relevant topics, several books will be used. \[Back\] covers topics in stochastic calculus and derivative pricing. \[Tsay\] covers time-series methods in financial econometrics, and is the most frequently used textbook. \[Cochrane\] and \[CL&M\] cover advanced topics in financial econometrics. \[D&S\] covers basic background in probability and statistics and can be used for review as necessary.

List of Topics
--------------

The class will cover the following core topics:

*   Absence of arbitrage and risk-neutral pricing;
*   Itô stochastic calculus, Black-Scholes model and extensions, interest rate models;
*   Dynamic programming, asset allocation, Merton's solution, numerical methods for dynamic portfolio choice;
*   Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing;
*   Maximum likelihood and quasi-maximum likelihood estimation;
*   Generalized method of moments (GMM) basics, regression as GMM, standard errors, delta-method;
*   Small-sample inference, bootstrap;
*   Volatility models, GARCH.

Advanced topics include:

*   Derivative pricing and dynamic portfolio choice;
*   Extensions of GARCH, MIDAS models, multivariate volatility models;
*   Exploiting return predictability.
